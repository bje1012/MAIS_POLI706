# R Markdown

Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document

# Download and Install \LaTeX{}

If you would like to create PDF documents from R Markdown, you will need to have a \LaTeX{} distribution installed (can be downloaded [here](https://tug.org/mactex/)). R Markdown users should also install TinyTeX, which can be installed through RStudio. \LaTeX{} provides the robust typesetting and formatting capabilities needed to produce well-structured documents. When you knit an R Markdown file to PDF, the process involves Pandoc converting the markdown content into \LaTeX{} code, which \LaTeX{} then compiles into a PDF.

# YAML

![YAML Sample](/Users/jieun/Desktop/YAML.png){width="60%"}

YAML is the metadata that tells R Markdown exactly how to process or display the document. You can adjust the font, font size, and spacing by using fontfamily: , fontsize: , and spacing: . For more options, please refer to [this resource](https://education.rstudio.com/blog/2019/10/tools-for-teaching-yaml-with-ymlthis/).

# Code Chunks

You can quickly insert chunks into your file with the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + Alt + I (OS X: Cmd + Option + I)

To hide your code but display the output in your PDF file, use echo=FALSE. If you wish to exclude both the code and its output from the PDF, use include=FALSE.

# Examples

Calculation

```{r}
(4 * 30 + 6)^0.5
```

Creating an object

```{r}
X1 <- 10
X2 <- 20
X3 <- X1 * X2

X3
```



# Homework submission rules

1.  Submissions must include both responses to the questions and/or interpretations of the output and the code necessary to complete each exercise in R.

2.  Submissions must be knitted/compiled to a PDF file.
